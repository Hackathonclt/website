                <p><h3 style="text-align:left">WHAT:</h3>
                    The Hackathon is a team-based contest where one of our sponsors will be posing a business sales problem, provide real world data to support it, and ask contestents to analyze, visualize, and present a compelling strategy to address the problem posed. The Hackathon events will be composed of three events plus a pre-hackathon Meet and Greet which is described further on the Meetup.org site.
                    <ol>
                        <li><h4>Kickoff</h4>
                            The Hackathon will officially begin with a Kickoff event on May 2nd. A problem will be presented at the Kickoff event and seed data will be provided. The participants are asked to address the problem and perform three specific tasks:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Analyze the provided data (participants are encouraged to augment with additional public data)</li>
                                    <li>Create Web Presentation</li>
                                    <li>Present Results in Lightning Presentation Session</li>
                                </ul>
                            This event requires cross-disciplinary skills and participants are encouraged to form teams of up to three people. Teams may be formed before the event or may form at the event.
                        </li>
                        <li><h4>Check-in</h4>
                            Halfway through the event, a Check-in and mentoring session is scheduled. This is also when final presentation slots will be scheduled. This is an optional event but teams that don't Check-in at the event must contact the organizers to get a Presentation Time at the Presentation and Awards event.
                        </li>
                        <li><h4>Presentations And Awards</h4>
                            The final event will occur two weeks after the Kickoff with a Presentation and Awards Ceremony on Sunday, May 19th. At this event, the teams will engage in Lightning Presentations in front of a panel of three judges and the audience. After the presentations and after an evaluation period, three winning teams will be chosen. An awards ceremony will commence and the winning teams will be recognized and prizes awarded.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
